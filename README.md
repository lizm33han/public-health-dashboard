I created this dashboard as part of a data project through the BroadStreet Institute Community Data Internship.

**Goals**

1) Improve the overal aesthetic of a dashboard (layout, color scheme)
2) Improve interactivity by including a variety of visuals and years to explore
3) Contextualize maternal mortality rates by including population density

I have included two versions of my data file (xlsx and csv), my workbook file (.twbx), and a screenshot of the dashboard.</p>
