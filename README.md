Maternal Mortality Tableau Dashboard

<p>I created this dashboard as part of a data project through the BroadStreet Institute Community Data Internship.

<p>My goals included:

<p> 1) Improve the overal aesthetic of a dashboard (layout, color scheme)
<br> 2) Improve interactivity by including a variety of visuals and years to explore
<br> 3) Contextualize maternal mortality rates by including population density
