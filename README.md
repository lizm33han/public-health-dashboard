Maternal Mortality Tableau Dashboard

<p>I created this dashboard as part of a data project through the BroadStreet Institute Community Data Internship.

<p>My goals included:

<p> 1) Improve the overal aesthetic of a dashboard (layout, color scheme)
<br> 2) Improve interactivity by including a variety of visuals and years to explore
<br> 3) Contextualize maternal mortality rates by including population density

<p>I have included two versions of my data file (xlsx and csv), my workbook file (.twbx), and a screenshot of the dashboard.</p>
<p>Feel free to check out the live dash board <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/elizabeth.meehan/viz/UnitedStatesMaternalMortalityDashboard/UnitedStatesMaternalMortalityDashboardComparingwithPopulationDensity">here</a>.</p>
